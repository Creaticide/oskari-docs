## Suomi.fi -maps

Finnish public sector organisations and actors performing official public regulatory roles have the possibility
to utilize [Suomi.fi - maps](http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/asioi-verkossa/suomifi-kartat) service for free.

This provides for example the Finnish municipalities the possibility to create 
embedded maps to their own websites and gain a stack of high quality data at the same time. 
One of the most interesting datasets added to the service is a simplified map for visually impaired and it is essential 
part of improved services for the public. The service provides also a possibility to attach your own datasets or interfaces to the service.
With Oskari APi (RPC) it is also possible to tailor the Suomi.fi -maps and apply own visual look or utilize own databases. 
One example of this is the [fishing restrictions service](https://kalastusrajoitus.fi/#/kalastusrajoitus).

The Population Register Centre in Finland is responsible for the development of Suomi.fi -maps together with the National Land Survey of Finland.
