## Visual Style Guide for Oskari

Version 1.0

This is our Oskari Visual Style Guide. This document defines standards for the use of the our visual identity.

The Visual Style Guide is a living document, initiated with the goal of developing a consistent message and image for Oskari. It is a “living” document because we expect it to expand as we cover more use cases where visual consistency is important and can be described using simpler rules. The standards and simple policies described here are designed to maintain the uniformity of presentation necessary for successful promotion and marketing efforts for the Oskari project.

This guide is based on a UI guide from 2015 and Oskari Otter design from 2019.
