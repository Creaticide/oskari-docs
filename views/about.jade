        This is a support site for the Oskari software containing technical instructions for using, configuring and developing the software. The documentation on this site assumes the reader is somewhat familiar with the basic
        geographical protocols used extensively in GIS applications, such as
        WMS (Web Map Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service). Also, experience in
        JavaScript and/or Java development is required to read and understand the frontend and
        the backend documentation, respectively.
