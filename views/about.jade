        This is a support site for the Oskari software containing technical instructions for using, configuring and developing the software. The documentation on this site assumes the reader is somewhat familiar with the basic
        geographical protocols used extensively in GIS applications, such as
        WMS (Web Map Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service). Also, experience in
        JavaScript and/or Java development is required to read and understand the frontend and
        the backend documentation, respectively.

              Using Oskari Slack requires login. Please contact oskari@nls.fi for credentials.

              Note that Oskari Slack is using the Lite plan, so the message archive is limited in size.

              Slack is great place to ask questions and talk directly to the core developers. However, users are expected to do their research beforehand and ask educated questions.
