      p This is a support site for the Oskari software containing technical instructions for using, configuring and developing the software. The documentation on this site assumes the reader is somewhat familiar with the basic
        | geographical protocols used extensively in GIS applications, such as
        | WMS (Web Map Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service). Also, experience in
        | JavaScript and/or Java development is required to read and understand the frontend and
        | the backend documentation, respectively.

              ### Mailing list ([Oskari-user@lists.osgeo.org](mailto:Oskari-user@lists.osgeo.org))
              The mailinglist is the main contact point for anything Oskari related. If you have something Oskari related on you mind ask for ideas or support from the mailing list.
              It can be used to discuss anything between developers, PSC and other interested parties of the community. 
              The mailing list is open and search engines can find the discussion threads. This helps finding solutions for already asked questions.

              ### Gitter ([gitter.im/oskariorg/chat](https://gitter.im/oskariorg/chat))
              For things that are more easily dealt with in a chat environment instead of emails. 
              If you need to ask something really quick, use Gitter. Remember Gitter is really good for instant messaging, but bear in mind that the history of the discussions might not be easily found. 
              So we encourage to use the mailing list. Please chat in English so everyone can participate in the discussion.
