              * Oskari user interface is implemented as a collection of reusable bundles. Bundles are used as uniform containers to ship and share new functionality to the application setups. 

              * Additions to existing functionality are implemented as Plugins shipped within the bundles. 

              * Server-side functionality of the platform is implemented as a Java servlet, which can also be extended to handle new functionality. 

              * Oskari uses standard Open Source components such as OpenLayers, GeoTools, GeoServer, Jackson and jQuery. The developed Open Source code stitches these applications together and makes it possible to extend the functionality of the platform in a coordinated manner.

              * The Oskari enables controlled extensibility. Service platform is kept flexible: functionality can be added as well as to the user interface and to the server, and the application libraries can be changed.

                #### Security issue found in versions 1.24.0-1.24.4!
                  The preprocess-method call was commented out on Oskari versions 1.24.0-1.24.4. This is a serious security issue as many of the admin functionalities depend on preprocess() to check that the user is an admin. On affected versions even Guest-users can use the admin functionalities.

                  We recommend you to update your application to version 1.24.5 to avoid this security risk. 

                  Hotfix available: https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari-server/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md#1245---security-patch
