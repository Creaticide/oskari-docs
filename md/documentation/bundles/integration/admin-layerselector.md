## Description

The bundle offers admin a listing for all the maplayers available in Oskari platform. The maplayers are grouped by topic or organization by selecting a tab in the upper part of the flyout. For each maplayer there is an icon presenting layer type (wms/wfs/base/wmts/vector)and an i-icon if the layer has a "dataurl" property. The admin can add new organizations and remove them. It is also possible to add new maplayers and remove old ones. Support for adding group and base layers and sublayers to them was added in Oskari version 1.13.

## TODO

* Add Inspire Themes (needs backend work)
* Handle capabilities query as far as possible in the backend
** There is too many exceptions etc. for clientside code to handle.
* GetMapLayers action route should return also empty organizations and classes
* Modal dialog when user is removing organization or layer
* Backend should return json if user is removing organization
* Backend should return error if user is removing organization which contains layer
* Map layer service should do something when layer is updated
* Backend should be configured to handle admin bundles based on user role
* Filter mechanism is not ready yet
* Add Organization & add Inspire theme needs some further work on layerSelector2 bundle
* When adding layer we should return also inspireName
* WFS layers...
