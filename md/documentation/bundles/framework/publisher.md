## Description

This Bundle provides functionality to define an embeddable map and save it to server so it can be published on another page. The user defines the domain the map will be published on, name and language for the map. The user can set the size of the published map, a selection of tools that will be overlayed on the map and affect the maplayers that are initially visible when the map is shown. The main map is modified to show a preview of the published map when the publisher is opened and it resumes to normal view once the publisher flyout is closed. The publisher can promote map layers to the user, but at the moment the configuration which layers are promoted and the promotion text is not passed from the server (defined in code so promotion could be easily configured but it isn't for now).

Users can select styling for the published map in 'Layout' panel. The colour scheme for GFI popups can be selected from six predefined colours and an own colour scheme with RGB codes can be created, font can be chosen from two predefined font sets (serif and sans-serif) and the style of the tools (pan buttons, zoombar, search plugin and layer selection plugin) can be selected from three predefined style sets: 'rounded', 'sharp' and '3d' all of which can be selected as either dark or light versions.

## Bundle state

No statehandling has been implemented.

## PublisherTools state

Published map tools state is managed by the PublisherToolsForm. When starting the Publisher bundle, the PublisherToolsForm uses the default state configs. These are preset with the preset state configs. The toolbar and publishedmyplaces2 configs are changed using the tools form (UI) and stored when published. When editing an existing published map, the PublisherToolsForm uses the default state configs and loads the stored state configs. The toolbar and publishermyplaces2 configs are changed using the tools form (UI) and uses the same preset default state config values instead of using the stored values as preset.

Default values has no tools selected and can be used to reset the tools state configs.

Preset values allow typically used tools to be selected as a result of activating another tool setting. E.g. selecting draw tools also selects all types of draw tools.
