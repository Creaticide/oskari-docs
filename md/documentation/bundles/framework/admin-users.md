## Description

User account administer interface.
Creating, deleting and modify users.

## TODO

* ''E-mail field?''
* ''Some sort of pagination''

## Bundle configuration

```javascript
{
    "restUrl" : "[(relative url for rest operations)]"
}
```

* restUrl is the URL for all the REST operations. It is added to the base ajax URL.
* operations are semi-REST at the moment; we use PUT, DELETE, etc., but use a parameter for UID instead of a path-like solution
