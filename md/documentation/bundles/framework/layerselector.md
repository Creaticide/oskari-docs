## Description

The bundle offers the user a listing for all the maplayers available in Oskari platform. The maplayers are grouped by topic or organization by selecting a tab in the upper part of the flyout. The user can filter maplayers by writing something in the input field. This helps the user to find the wanted layer from the long list. Pressing enter key opens up a related keywords popup for advanced filtering. For each maplayer there is an icon presenting layer type (wms/wfs/base/wmts/vector)and an i-icon if the layer has a "dataurl" property. Pressing the I-icon sends out a request to show the page behind dataurl to the user. The user can add the maplayer to the map by checking the checkbox next to layername (or uncheck to remove it from map).

## TODO

* i-link handling
* handles wmts icon eventhough its not a core layer type

## Bundle configuration

No configuration is required. Assumes that MapLayerService has been initialized and can be fetched from sandbox.

Optional configuration to show published layers tab:

```javascript
{
  "conf": {
    "showPublishedTab" : true,
    showSearchSuggestions : true     // if keyword search on, if needed
  }
}
```

## Bundle state

```javascript
{
  "state": {
    "tab" : "Aiheittain",
    "groups" : ["Energiavarat","Geologia"],
    "filter" : ""
  }
}
```

Where:

* tab - the selected tab
* groups - layers groups that are open
* filter - the "search" text/text with what layers are filtered

If filter is given, open groups will be ignored. If filter is undefined, groups will be opened as stated in groups array.
