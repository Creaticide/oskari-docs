# Oskari RPC

One of the features of Oskari is the ability to define a map that can be embedded to another website. The maplayers selections and other settings can be done using an easy to use user interface. While this is a powerful feature on its own the RPC-functionality adds the ability to control the embedded map and react to events on the map from the embedding website.

Here's a tutorial how to work with RPC: [FOSS4G 2019 Bucharest workshop](/documentation/examples/FOSS4G_2019/workshop)
