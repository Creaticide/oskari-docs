# Pull request best practices


This page is for Oskari contributors. A contributor is anyone who wants contribute code, documentation, or tests to Oskari project.



#### The preferred way of contributing to Oskari in a nutshell:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [license terms](/documentation/development/license)
2. Fork [oskari](https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari), [oskari-server](https://github.com/nls-oskari/oskari-server) on GitHub 
3. Develop your code in a feature branch 
4. Notify us when the code is ready for QA and integration testing (GitHub pull request, email, anything really) 

[Here](/documentation/development/oskari_git_process) is Oskari git process


#### To save our work we wish that you use some practices described below:

* If you have developed a new feature. Please document your work in some level. You can see some examples in http://oskari.org/documentation/bundles

* Think little bit fore hand what are you going to contribute and try to keep it small or compact (we donâ€™t wish to have a pull request which has changes to all over Oskari  :)  )

* Use code formatter. If you are developing backend code using eclipce or Idea you might want install e.g.



Now!  happy coding. We are waiting your contribution!!!  :)
